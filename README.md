# Codtech--Task-2
Codtech Internship Task 2 - "Malware Analysis Sandbox"
### Project Overview: Malware Analysis Sandbox

#### Objective:
The purpose of this project is to create a Python-based Malware Analysis Sandboxâ€”a controlled environment for safely executing and analyzing malware. The sandbox isolates the malware to prevent it from affecting the host system and monitors various aspects of its behavior, including file system changes, process creation, and network activity.

#### Features:

1. **Process Monitoring**:
   - Tracks new processes spawned during malware execution.
   - Logs detailed information about each new process, such as its name and process ID (PID).

2. **File System Monitoring**:
   - Detects changes to the file system, specifically within the sandbox directory.
   - Monitors for file creation, modification, and deletion during malware execution.

3. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Logs outgoing network connections established by the malware.
   - Records details such as remote IP addresses and ports used by the malware.

4. **Malware Execution**:
   - The malware is executed in a controlled manner inside the sandbox.
   - A timeout is enforced to ensure that malware does not run indefinitely, preventing potential harm to the system.

5. **File Integrity Check**:
   - Calculates and logs the SHA-256 hash of files before and after execution to detect changes or modifications made by the malware.

6. **Sandbox Environment**:
   - Creates an isolated directory (`sandbox`) for executing and observing malware.
   - Once the analysis is complete, the environment is cleaned up to remove any potentially harmful artifacts.

7. **Logging and Reporting**:
   - Detailed logs are generated for file system changes, process creation, and network activity.
   - Logs provide insights into the malware's behavior, which helps in understanding its impact.

#### Workflow:

1. **Sandbox Creation**:
   - A sandbox directory is created to contain the malware and log files.
   
2. **Malware Preparation**:
   - The malware sample is copied to the sandbox directory to prevent it from accessing critical parts of the host system.

3. **Monitoring and Execution**:
   - The system monitors file system activity, process creation, and network connections during the execution of the malware.
   - The malware is executed within the sandbox, and its behavior is logged in real-time.

4. **Analysis and Cleanup**:
   - After execution, the logs are analyzed to determine the malware's impact.
   - The sandbox is cleaned up to remove any residual files or processes created during the analysis.

#### Use Cases:
- **Cybersecurity Professionals**: This tool can help professionals analyze malware behavior in a controlled environment without risking damage to their systems.
- **Researchers and Students**: Provides a framework for studying malware characteristics, file changes, process creation, and network activity during an infection.
- **Incident Response Teams**: Allows teams to understand the behavior of malware samples discovered during security incidents, aiding in the development of mitigation strategies.

#### Future Enhancements:
1. **Full Virtualization**: Incorporate virtualization (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware) to safely run malware in a fully isolated virtual environment, preventing any impact on the host system.
2. **Advanced Monitoring**: Integrate more advanced monitoring for registry changes, API calls, and deeper memory analysis.
3. **Automated Analysis Reports**: Implement automated report generation with detailed summaries and insights from the logs.
4. **Multi-Sample Analysis**: Allow for batch analysis of multiple malware samples in parallel, improving the scalability of the sandbox for larger malware investigations.

This project provides an initial framework for a malware analysis sandbox with the ability to safely execute and monitor malware behavior.
